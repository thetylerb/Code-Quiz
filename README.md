# Code Quiz


    I spent a lot of time this week looking up a few different youtubers who have really helped put things into perspective for me. I'm still a little wonky on some details... such as how to restart this quiz once you get to the end of one quiz and how to deal with timers on the quiz. BUT you can enjoy 2 quizzes with responsive CSS :)

Also whenever I've been trying to add images to this README.md file, it doesn't show up correctly. Not sure what I need to do to fix that for the future.
